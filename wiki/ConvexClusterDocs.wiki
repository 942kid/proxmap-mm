#summary Usage for _convexcluster_.

= Introduction =

I have only tested on a Linux platform but there is no reason this C++ program should not run on Mac or Windows with proper adjustments to the makefile. Please contact me if you run into issues on Linux or other platforms.

= Compile =

Please follow the general instructions found in Intro. We also included some utility functions for generating the k nearest neighbor weight file, so if you need to compile these, this can be done with commands *make distance* and *make knn_weights* from the *src/convex_clustering* directory.

= Running examples =

This section should get you up and running quickly, using Fisher's famous Iris data set, downloaded from the UCI machine learning repository. Enter the *examples* directory. You can edit the *run_iris.sh* file if you wish to edit the weighting parameters _k_ and _phi_. Running _convexcluster_ simply entails executing *./run_iris.sh*. We also include a plotting utility for visualizing the cluster results on the first two principal components of the data. You will need *R* and the R libary *ggplot2* in order for this script to run. Execute *./plot_iris.sh* to run the script, and open *iris_projection.pdf* in your favorite PDF viewer.
